#Types of Scopes (LEGB Rule)

#Python follows the LEGB rule for variable lookup:

L (Local): Variables defined within a function or block have local scope. They are only accessible within that function or block.
E (Enclosing): If a variable is not found locally, Python searches enclosing functions (nested functions) for the variable.
G (Global): Variables defined outside all functions have global scope. They are accessible from anywhere in the program.
B (Built-in): Built-in functions and variables are part of Pythonâ€™s core functionality and are always accessible.
count = 10  # Global variable

def outer_function():
  count = 5  # Local variable within outer_function

  def inner_function():
    count = 2  # Local variable within inner_function
    print(f"Inner function: {count}")  # Accesses local count (2)

  inner_function()
  print(f"Outer function: {count}")  # Accesses local count (5)

print(f"Global scope: {count}")  # Accesses global count (10)

outer_function()
