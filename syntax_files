//expression: This is the value you want to match against different patterns.
case pattern: Each case statement defines a pattern to match against the expression.
code_block: The code block associated with a matching pattern is indented and executed.
_ (wildcard): An optional _(underscore) can be used as a wildcard pattern to match anything not explicitly covered by other cases. This serves as a default case.//

match expression:
    case pattern1:
        code_block_1

        code_block_2
    ...
    case pattern_n:
