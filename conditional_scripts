//This program first takes the userâ€™s age as input. Then, the if statement checks if the age is greater than or equal to 18 (the voting age). If the condition is True, the program displays a message indicating eligibility. If the condition is False (age less than 18), the else block executes, and the program displays a message stating ineligibility.//

//This program takes the purchase amount as input. It then uses a series of conditional statements: * The first if statement checks if the purchase amount is greater than or equal to 1000. If so, it applies a 10% discount. * The elif statement checks if the amount is between 500 and 1000 (excluding 1000). If so, it applies a 5% discount. * If neither of the above conditions is met, the else block executes, and no discount is applied. * Finally, the program calculates the final price by applying the discount and displays it to the user.//

purchase_amount = float(input("Enter your purchase amount: "))

if purchase_amount >= 1000:
  discount = 0.1  # 10% discount
elif purchase_amount >= 500:
  discount = 0.05  # 5% discount
else:
  discount = 0  # No discount

final_price = purchase_amount * (1 - discount)

//This program takes the studentâ€™s score as input. It then uses a chain of if statements to check for specific score ranges and assigns the corresponding letter grade.//

elif score >= 80:
  grade = "B"
